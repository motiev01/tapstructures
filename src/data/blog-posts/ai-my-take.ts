  content: `Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the construction industry in ways that were unimaginable just a decade or even years ago. From optimizing project designs and assessing scope gaps, to generating detailed issued-for-construction (IFC) set and Professional Architect-approved construction drawings, AI is a game-changer. As someone who's working at the intersection of technology and construction, I've seen firsthand how these modern tools outperform the old days' methods (in specific use cases) and I've learned the importance of using them well.

AI-powered tools will enhance performance, accelerate progress, and empower us to tackle the complex challenges of day-to-day construction instantly and effortlessly. We will be able to train client models privately and securely (encrypted) to predict project timelines with crazy accuracy, spot potential safety hazards or authority-having-jurisdiction (AHJ) violations before they turn into costly problems, pick up any fine details that slipped through the cracks during review, and optimize resource allocation across even the trickiest projects. These advancements don't just make us more efficient, they make us superhuman, letting us deliver better results while cutting waste and time that bloats the industry.

I'm a full believer and see AI's huge potential, yet the human element is still more critical than ever. AI isn't a replacement for skilled pros, it's an enhancement. Let me say that again. AI IS NOT A REPLACEMENT (for everyone). I believe the best implementations will strike a careful balance. AI is great at handling repetitive data-heavy tasks like crunching numbers for cost estimates or flagging potential delays which frees up human expertise for creative problem-solving and relationship management. The bread and butter of construction. A well-designed building isn't just about numbers. It's about understanding local jurisdictions, client wants/needs, and navigating the surprises that will surely pop up.

There are surely infinite possibilities and ways to run with AI that want to send me off to the races. I think one of the most exciting ventures and one that I want to help inspire is talking to your documents. Essentially, to simplify the tedious sifting and sorting and searching for every document, report, submittal, notice, delivery, status, meeting, etc... It's exhausting. In years to come, sooner than we may imagine, we will have fully contextual AI that can give you exactly what you need, when you need it, with no effort (especially helpful for our old-school guys).`,
